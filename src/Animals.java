/*
2.Create another Class to represent an Animal that lives in the Zoo. Here are some following characteristics of the Animal Class:
a.Holds the following information about the Animal:
Animal Species
Name
Number of Legs
Gender
b.Has the ability to print out a description of the Animal using the class level information
3.Create at 3 additional Classes that extend the Animal Class and represent 3 different species:
a.Giraffe:
-When a Giraffe is created, define the current height (in meters)
-Has a method that can be used to compare how this Giraffeâ€™s height compares to other Giraffes. For your reference:
Male giraffes are an average of 5.5 meters tall
Female giraffes are an average of 4.6 meters tall
b.Crocodile
-When a Crocodile is created, define the number of teeth it has
-Has a method that logs out its favorite food
c.Giant Tortoise
-When a Giant Tortoise is created, define its current age
-Has a method to determine whether the Giant Tortoise is young, middle-aged, or old. For your reference:
Under 50 is young
Between 50 - 100 is middle-aged
Over 100 is old

4. Run the program to demonstrate that you have accomplished all the requirements.
